# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

First, create the context by importing `createContext` from react, using `createContext()`, and default export the variable the context was created. Then, make sure the context gets rendered by adding `.Provider` when creating a HTML tag in JS. When it comes to using context, we use `.useContext()` and the variable that stores the context would be inside the parenthesis.
